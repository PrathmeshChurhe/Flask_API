# Flask API Application

This project is a Flask-based API that handles various request and response functionalities, including integration with external services. The application also offers a set of utility functions for generating responses with text, suggestions, and context.

## Features

- **Basic Flask Server**: Runs a Flask API with a default route.
- **Custom Response Functions**: Functions to generate text and suggestion chip responses.
- **Timezone and Date Utilities**: Includes utilities for working with timezones, particularly set to `Asia/Kolkata`.
- **Image Handling with PIL**: Capable of creating and modifying images using Python's PIL (Pillow) library.
- **AWS Integration**: Contains code for connecting to AWS services (via Boto3), though specific details may need configuration.
- **External API Requests**: Uses `requests` for making API calls to other services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Required Python packages (listed below)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    - `project_url`: Set this to the base URL of the project, if applicable.
    - `api_password`: Add an API password for secure access, if needed.

4. **Run the Server**:
    Start the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    By default, the server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Available Routes

- **Root (`/`)**:
  - Returns a simple message indicating that the API is live (e.g., "Flask API").

### Utility Functions

- **`return_text_and_suggestion_chip_with_context()`**:
    - Generates a JSON response with text, suggestion chips, and context parameters.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `text`: Text message to be included in the response.
      - `suggestions`: List of suggestion titles.
      - `context_session`: Context session details.
      - `context_parameter_name`: Context parameter name.
      - `context_value`: Value for the context parameter.

### Configuration and Additional Setup

- **Timezone Settings**: Set to `Asia/Kolkata` by default using the `pytz` library.
- **AWS Integration**: This file includes code that uses `boto3`, indicating possible integration with AWS services. Ensure that AWS credentials are properly configured if using these features.
- **Image Processing**: Uses the Pillow library for image manipulation. 

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a sample request to the root route:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/
